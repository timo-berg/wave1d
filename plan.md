### 6

Relevant statistic
- measurement should be always within kalman spread 
- check if min(ensemble)<meausrement<max(ensemble)

### 7

- (not sure) ensemble mean should approximate the (synthetic) measurement because we average out the measurement noise
- verify: compute RMSE between measurement and ensemble mean
- convergence rate is that of the CLT so 1/sqrt(n) (I think)
